# 🧠 AI-Powered Resume Intelligence & JD Tailoring System

A hands-on **GenAI student project** that leverages **NLP, local LLMs (Mistral 7B)**, and a **Flask-based web interface** to provide meaningful, secure, and offline-capable resume insights. Designed to simulate how a smart recruiter would evaluate resumes against job descriptions.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Upload Resume (PDF/DOCX)** + Paste **Job Description**
2. Backend extracts:
   - Email, Phone, Skills from Resume
   - Skills from Job Description
3. A **Skill Matching Engine** compares and calculates:
   - ✅ Matched Skills
   - ❌ Missing Skills
   - 📈 Match Percentage
4. A **local LLM (Mistral 7B)** generates:
   - ✍️ Suggestions to improve resume
   - 📝 Tailored Resume Content
   - 💌 AI-generated Cover Letter
5. Cover letter can be **downloaded as .txt**
6. Results displayed in a modern, professional UI

## 💡 Motivation

In a world where recruitment is increasingly automated, keyword-based filters dominate initial screening. But candidates are more than keywords.

This project explores how GenAI can provide real, personalized feedback — turning resumes into narratives that match what the job truly requires. Built with privacy and transparency in mind, this app operates fully offline and can be adapted for students, job platforms, and HR tech prototypes.

This is a student research project and not intended for production use.

Inspired by real-world resume parsing tools and recruiter feedback.
